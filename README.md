This Java program is designed to analyze code written in a compact programming language, "tiny language." Upon receiving input, the program initiates a process of lexical analysis, breaking down the input into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals. Subsequently, it proceeds with syntax parsing, where it identifies the structure of the code based on the predefined grammar rules of the tiny language, constructing a parse tree of the code's structure. The program will conduct semantic analysis to ensure adherence to additional language rules beyond syntax. Finally, it generates output based on the parsed code, which could involve executing the code, performing optimizations, or producing intermediate representations for further processing (depending on input).
